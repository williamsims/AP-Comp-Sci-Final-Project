  There are many different aspects to the design of this skill. The different intents 
and the slots are used to determine the correct response to anything a user talls Alexa. 
The invocation name of this skill is Earthquake Probability. This name will be easy to 
to remember what the skill does in comparison to many other invation names you may need
to remember. 

  After crreating the invocation name I created three diffetent intents that will be needed
for the skill to run correctly. These three intents used are introintent, list_states, and 
choose_states. The introintent has the purpose of asking the initial question when the user
opens the skill and starts the conversation. 

  The list_states intent is used when the user asks Alexa to tell them the states they can 
choose from to learn their risk of an Earthquake. When Alexa hears the user say one of the
sample utterances, the corresponding function in the lambda code will run. The code takes 
the entire states array and uses a for loop to list all of the states for the user to hear.
