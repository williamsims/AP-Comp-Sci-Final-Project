This is the user manual for Alexa's Earthquake Probability skill. 

    The Earthquake Probability skill is an Alexa skill that is able to be used 
on any Alexa device. This skill allows the user to find out the risk of an 
Earthquake happening in their state or any other state around the United States. 

    To open the skill simply say "Alexa, open earthquake probability" After this
phrase you must also start the conversation within the skill. You can do this by 
adding on "and talk to me", "and let's talk", "and give me information", or
"and talk to me about earthquake risks".

    Now that you have started the conversation, Alexa will ask you to name the 
state that you would like to know the risk of an earthquake occuring. This is where 
the user can either respond with a state or ask for Alexa to list all of the state 
they can choose from. The user can respond with phrases including "list the states",
"what are the states", "what can I choose from", "tell me the states", and
"tell me all the states". These phrases will prompt Alexa to list all of the states
you can choose from and allow you to answer back with the name of a state. The user
can also skip the step of listing the states and just say the name of a state. If
you respond with something that is not a U.S. state, Alexa will ask you to respond 
with valid state name. 

    After naming a state Alexa will respond with the its risk of an earthquake.
The format of her response will look like:
        "The risk of an Earthquake in [state] is [risk]. 

    Ultimately, this skill allows you to have a better understanding of Earthquake
risks in your own state and other states around the country.
